5 - Playing a game at home gives a clear advantage, with 13+% more chance to win the game. (NB: instructions request side bar charts, but a stacked bar chart allows for a clearer visualization of the advantage given by the home location).

7 - Which team in 2016 had the highest percent of pass completions? Minnesota Vikings (70.3%)

8 - NB: I chose to reverse the requested color palette so that it is more consistent with the previous graphs (where red = win).
